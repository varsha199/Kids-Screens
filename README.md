**Understanding and managing digital screen time for kids in India**  

The **Digital Kids 2025** project explores how children in India are using smartphones, tablets, computers, and other digital devices in their daily lives. With increased access to online learning, entertainment, and social platforms, understanding screen time habits is crucial for promoting healthy digital behavior.

---

## 📍 Project Overview

This project investigates:
- Screen time usage patterns among children aged **8–18**
- Factors influencing daily screen habits
- The relationship between screen use, health, and learning outcomes

We aim to provide actionable insights for **parents, educators, healthcare professionals, and policymakers**.

## 🎯 Goals

1. Analyze screentime behavior among Indian children.
2. Identify patterns and risk factors related to excessive/unstructured screen use.
3. Recommend strategies for **healthier digital engagement**.

🧪 Hypotheses
📊 Age Factor: Older kids (12–16) have more screen time than younger ones (5–11).

🎬 Entertainment: Entertainment-heavy usage correlates with higher total screen time.

🌙 Late Usage: Screen use after 9 PM impacts sleep quality.

👀 Parental Monitoring: Active monitoring reduces daily screen time.

📱 Device Ownership: Personal device ownership increases screen usage.
